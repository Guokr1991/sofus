\subsection{Detailed Description}
Nodes and weight for quadrature. 

\hypertarget{group__GL_gl_abstract}{}\subsection{Abstract}\label{group__GL_gl_abstract}
This module is used for performing integration using Gauss-\/\+Legendre quadrature. Nodes and weights are computed using an iteration-\/free concept adapted from the paper.

I. Bogaert, \char`\"{}\+Iteration-\/\+Free Computation of Gauss-\/\+Legendre Quadrature Nodes and Weights\char`\"{}, S\+I\+A\+M Journal of Scientific Computing.

The first number of nodes and weights are precomputed using a iterative approach and tabulated. The remaining nodes and weights are computed using the above mentioned iteration-\/free concept.\hypertarget{group__GL_gl_introduction}{}\subsection{Introduction}\label{group__GL_gl_introduction}
A very brief introduction to quadrature rules is given here together with instruction of how to apply the library for numerical integration.

In numerical analysis, a quadrature rule is an approximation of the definite integral of a function, usually stated as a weighted sum of function values at specified points within the domain of integration. An n-\/point Gaussian quadrature rule, named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, is a quadrature rule constructed to yield an exact result for polynomials of degree 2n − 1 or less by a suitable choice of the points xi and weights wi for i = 1, ..., n. The domain of integration for such a rule is conventionally taken as \mbox{[}−1, 1\mbox{]}, so the rule is stated as

\[ \int_{-1}^{1} f(x) dx = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \omega_i f(x_i) \]

Gaussian quadrature as above will only produce good results if the function $f(x)$ is well approximated by a polynomial function within the range $[−1, 1]$. The method is not, for example, suitable for functions with singularities. However, if the integrated function can be written as $ f(x)=\omega (x)g(x)\,$, where $g(x)$ is approximately polynomial and $\omega(x)$ is known, then alternative weights $\omega_{i}'$ and points $ x_{i}'$ that depend on the weighting function $\omega(x)$ may give better results, where

\[ \int_{-1}^{1}f(x)\,dx=\int_{-1}^{1}\omega (x)g(x)\,dx\approx \sum_{i=1}^{n}\omega_{i}'g(x_{i}'). \]

Common weighting functions include $ \omega (x)=1/{\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}\,$ (Chebyshev–\+Gauss) and $\omega (x)=e^{-x^{2}}$ (Gauss–\+Hermite). It can be shown (see Press, et al., or Stoer and Bulirsch) that the evaluation points xi are just the roots of a polynomial belonging to a class of orthogonal polynomials.\hypertarget{group__GL_gl_gl_quadrature}{}\subsubsection{Gauss-\/\+Legendre quadrature}\label{group__GL_gl_gl_quadrature}
For the simplest integration problem stated above, i.\+e. with $\omega (x)=1$, the associated polynomials are Legendre polynomials, $P_n(x)$, and the method is usually known as Gauss–\+Legendre quadrature. With the n-\/th polynomial normalized to give $P_n(1) = 1$, the i-\/th Gauss node, $x_i$, is the i-\/th root of $P_n$; its weight is given by (Abramowitz \& Stegun 1972, p. 887)

\[ \omega_{i}={\frac {2}{\left(1-x_{i}^{2}\right)[P'_{n}(x_{i})]^{2}}}. \]\hypertarget{group__GL_gl_change_of_interval}{}\subsubsection{Change of interval}\label{group__GL_gl_change_of_interval}
An integral over \mbox{[}a, b\mbox{]} must be changed into an integral over $[−1, 1]$ before applying the Gaussian quadrature rule. This change of interval can be done in the following way\+:

\[ \int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx={\frac {b-a}{2}}\int_{-1}^{1}f\left({\frac {b-a}{2}}x+{\frac {a+b}{2}}\right)\,dx. \]

Applying the Gaussian quadrature rule then results in the following approximation\+:

\[ \int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx={\frac {b-a}{2}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}\omega_{i}f\left({\frac {b-a}{2}}x_{i}+{\frac {a+b}{2}}\right). \]\hypertarget{group__GL_gl_usage}{}\subsection{Using the library}\label{group__GL_gl_usage}
